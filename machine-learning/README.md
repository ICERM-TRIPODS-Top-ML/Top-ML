# ICERM-TRIPODS-Top-ML
This subfolder contains machine learning examples (no topology yet).

This repository contains scripts for applying clustering and classification algorithms in Python, and relies on sklearn and numpy. 

The code in this repository was taken and modified from: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html and http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html. 

To run the cluster comparison code try:
``` 
python cluster_compare.py 
```

To run the classification compariosn code try:
``` 
python classifier_compare.py 
```
